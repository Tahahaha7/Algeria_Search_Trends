# Exploring Google Search Trends in Algeria

Every year Google posts [Year in Search](https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2019/US/), a recap of the most searched topics for many countries. Sadly, the reports don't cover Algeria, so I decided to make a series of interesting searches that might challenge our prejudgments and maybe even inspire us. The data is compiled for the last 5 years and is also publicly availible throught [Google Trends API](https://trends.google.com/).

_Please don't hesitate to recommend any interesting topics to explore_
